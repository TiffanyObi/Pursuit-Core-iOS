//you can put -> Void after the parameters but the less code the better. internal parameter name is used in the function body definition. external parameter is used by the caller, they will see the extername name.
//default parameter value. we will set in age is 21 in the came the user or the caller of our fucntion does not provide an age we will default to showing 21.
//set default value on the data type that your interested in. ex age : Int = 21.

// - can be passes as function parameters
// - can be returned from a function

 Built -in functions (or higher order functions ) in swift!
  use some built in higher order functions (closures)
    - map {....} - transforms a value. ex: 4 * 4 = 16
 returns an array
 
    - filter {....} - filters values based on a condition
 returns an array of collection
 
    - reduce (, +) - takes an intial value, 0 and a closure ex "+" (addition) and combines all the values and returns the result
 
    - compactMap {....} - returns non-nil values
 
    - sorted { > } - you provide a sorting closure and it returns the collection sorted accordingly
 
    - forEach {....} - similar to the for-in loop
